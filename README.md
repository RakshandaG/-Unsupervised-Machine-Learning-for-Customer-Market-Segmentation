# -Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-for-Customer-Market-Segmentation
Using KMeans & PCA algorithm of Unsupervised Machine
Learning Customers are classified based on their data like credit
card limit, amount of transactions, frequency of transactions etc.
In this project Iâ€™ve learnt to apply KMeans, PCA algorithms and
elbow method to calculate optimal number of clusters.
